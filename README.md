# FirstGame.Python

My first Python console game

The main idea of the game:
there is a rectangular field on which trees and rivers are located.The trees will grow periodically and light up periodically.The task is to extinguish these trees in time with the help of a helicopter.
The helicopter moves around the map, flying over a cage with water, it dials it into a tank and can extinguish one tree.If the tree is not extinguished in time, it will burn, and the fire will spread.
If the tree burns to the ground, we lose points.If the tree goes out, we get points.Weather conditions will also be added.The helicopter will have its own number of lives.There will be a hospital, 
where you can fly and get health for points.There will also be an upgrade shop where you can increase the number of water tanks
